For this lab, I worked with treemaps and animated transitions.  I made a treemap of the data from assignment 2.  There is a slider to change what depth of the tree the coloring is based on.  When sliding the slider, the treemap will transition to the new coloring.  
Like in assignment 2, I have grouped animals that are exactly the same into single nodes.
